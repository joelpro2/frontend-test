[Diamond](https://www.diamondbybold.com/) is a Creative Technology agency that creates innovative products and inspiring digital experiences through technology. We specialize in creating digital solutions, combining our knowledge in: _Technology and Inovation_ (VR/AR/Gaming, Web, Web development, Microsoft and Frontend and mobile solutions) and _Creative & Marketing_ (UI/UX Design and Digital Marketing).

## About the challenge


This is a simple test in which you should be able to develop a _Vue/React/Angular/Svelte/Vanilla_ app, using the provided layout as reference. You'll need to make _requests_ to an API to get some _JSON_ data, filter the response and show them on the page.

You're welcome to use any boilerplate/approach you feel confortable with, but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favourite dev toolset to create an app that's robust.

### The app should be a movie search with two pages:

- **Home page:** with a search field and a results list;

_Think about an empty state, a loading state and a no results state_

- **Movie page:** movie details page;

_Think about a loading state and a no results state_


The goal of this challenge is to evaluate your HTML, CSS, Javascript e _Vue/React/Angular/Svelte/Vanilla_, API and general approach when developing a simple Web App, with a couple of pages and an API feed. The final HTML, CSS and Javascript code is also taken in consideration.

## First steps

1. _Fork_ the current repository into your personal account;
2. Create a _branch_ with your name;
3. Finish the challenge in the best way possible;

**Send us your code in this two ways.**


1. Send us a _PR_ (Pull Request);
2. Send us an email with your source on a _zip_ to: digital@diamondbybold.com with the title **[Frontend - Test] - @your-name**

### Hints/Suggestions

- Write a good README with basic information (Ex.: how to run start the project and build it);
- There's no layout for mobile, but if you take the time to make it responsive, that's a huge plus. We'd like to see your UI/UX skills too. 
- Feel free to work on and improve the provided layouts. Just think of them as guidelines.
- There's a like button in the details page. It would be great if that data was persistent.
- Think about using a CSS methodology, like BEM, ITCSS, etc;
- Asking questions makes the world go round. We'll not penalize anyone for asking questions.
- Sometimes the API server is slow, that being said, think about loading and emptying states throughout your app;
- We're looking for something that tells us you understand concepts such as events, promises and reactivity and how those concepts are implemented in Javascript;
- The use of unit tests will be taken into account, but not a probatory factor.
- Your git history will be very valuable.
- The code will be evaluated by: semantics, structuring, readibility, size, elegance (amongst other things);

### Needed Info

#### API:

We recommend that you use [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), nevertheless you can use any other API that you prefer.

#### Prototype / Style guide:

Look inside the `/layout` folder, there you'll find what you need.
